This is the current proposal for adding Servo support based on feedback from Bjoern Hartmann, Shigeru Kobayashi, and Erik Sjodin. The core idea is to just add a "config" message, then use the SET_PIN_MODE message to attach/detach Servo support to a pin. This is how hardware PWM is currently handled. This would save space in the protocol by reusing the SET_PIN_MODE message, but the host software implementation could have a different interface, e.g. Arduino's attach() and detach().

minPulse, maxPulse, and angle are all 14-bit unsigned integers. Angle is in degrees. The SERVO_CONFIG can be sent at any time to change the settings.
